      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think most designers and creatives make bad founders, especially early in their careers when they don’t have much experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe this is worth discussing because when you see symptoms, the first step is to come to a diagnosis—to understand why something is happening and then work on a cure. This is an attempt to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every day, we hear about young founders—right out of college—raising funds and building startups. These are usually engineers, and sometimes MBAs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Consumption and Privacy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By this writing I want to explore digital privacy and consumption. My motivation for exploring this is trying to be more mindful of what I let into my life, not limited to food or air or people but products. I have always had the belief that the products we use have a considerable impact on our life but their impact is also overlooked, with the incorrect assumption that using them is a one way interaction where we extract value from them but they don’t have any affect on who we are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
