## Hi, I'm Shaurya

I'm a Software Designer and Creative Technologist currently leading UX at Wongdoody. I believe software is one of the most malleable creative mediums we have, and I'm constantly exploring its boundaries.

## What I'm Interested In

Right now, I'm fascinated by:
- How tools connect with each other and act on our behalf
- Multimodal interaction design (voice, gesture, screen)
- The intersection of AI and creative tools
- Building systems that adapt without losing user agency

## Background

I studied Communication Design and Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. Those years shaped how I think about designâ€”not just as making things look good, but as a way of thinking through complex problems.

## Philosophy

I believe good design:
- Finds the balance between beauty and practicality
- Respects user agency while reducing cognitive burden
- Adapts to people rather than forcing people to adapt
- Is both opinionated and flexible

## Currently

- Leading UX initiatives at Wongdoody
- Exploring AI-augmented design tools
- Writing about design systems and interaction patterns
- Experimenting with generative art

## Let's Connect
