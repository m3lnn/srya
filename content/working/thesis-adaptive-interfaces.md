## Overview

My master's thesis exploring how interfaces can adapt to user behavior, context, and intent without explicit user configuration. The work investigated the balance between personalization and predictability in interactive systems.

## Research Question

**How can interfaces adapt to user behavior patterns while maintaining usability and user trust?**

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Observational Study
Conducted contextual inquiries with 24 participants across different professions to understand:
- How they customize their tools
- What adaptations they find helpful vs. annoying
- When they want control vs. automation

### Phase 2: Prototyping
Built three prototype systems testing different adaptation approaches:
1. **Predictive UI**: Anticipates next actions based on patterns
2. **Contextual UI**: Adapts based on time, location, and activity
3. **Progressive UI**: Gradually reveals complexity based on expertise

### Phase 3: Evaluation
12-week longitudinal study with 18 participants testing prototypes in real workflows.

## Key Findings

1. **Transparency is Critical**: Users trusted adaptive systems that explained their reasoning
2. **Gradual Adaptation Works Better**: Sudden changes were disorienting; gradual shifts went unnoticed
3. **Context Matters More Than History**: Current context was more predictive than past behavior
4. **Control as Escape Hatch**: Users wanted the ability to override adaptations easily

## Design Principles

Based on research, I proposed five principles for adaptive interfaces:

1. **Explain Changes**: Always show why the interface adapted
2. **Adapt Gradually**: Smooth transitions over jarring changes
3. **Provide Override**: One-click return to default state
4. **Learn from Corrections**: When users override, learn from it
5. **Respect Expertise**: Adapt differently for novices vs. experts

## Impact

- Published at CHI 2024
- Cited in 12 subsequent papers
- Design principles adopted by CMU's design systems team
- Influenced product decisions at internship at Wongdoody

## Tools & Methods

- Figma for prototyping
- Python + TensorFlow for behavior modeling
- React for functional prototypes
- R for statistical analysis

## Personal Growth

This work fundamentally changed how I think about designing intelligent systems. I learned that the goal isn't to remove human agency but to reduce cognitive burden while maintaining control. The best adaptive systems are ones you barely notice.
