## Overview

An experimental design system that uses machine learning to suggest component variations, accessibility improvements, and contextual adaptations based on usage patterns and user behavior.

## Challenge

Traditional design systems are staticâ€”they provide components but don't help designers make contextual decisions about which variant to use, how to compose them, or when to break the rules. As design systems scale, the cognitive load of choosing the right patterns increases.

## Approach

We built an intelligent layer on top of our React component library that:
- Analyzes component usage patterns across products
- Suggests appropriate component choices based on context
- Auto-generates accessible variants
- Provides real-time feedback on composition and hierarchy

### Key Features

1. **Context-Aware Suggestions**: The system analyzes the current page structure and suggests appropriate components
2. **Accessibility Intelligence**: Automatically identifies and suggests fixes for accessibility issues
3. **Usage Analytics**: Tracks how components are used to improve recommendations
4. **Adaptive Theming**: Learns from user preferences to suggest theme modifications

## Technical Implementation

Built with:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- TensorFlow.js for ML models
- Custom AST parser for code analysis
- Real-time collaboration via WebSockets

## Impact

- 40% reduction in time spent choosing components
- 95% of AI suggestions accepted by designers
- Eliminated 80% of common accessibility violations
- Adopted by 3 internal product teams

## Reflections

This project taught me that AI tooling works best when it augments rather than replaces human decision-making. The most successful features were those that provided suggestions and context, not automated solutions.
